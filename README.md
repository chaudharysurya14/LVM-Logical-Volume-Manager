## Overview

Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a powerful tool for managing disk storage on Linux systems. It allows users to create, resize, and manage disk partitions (volumes) dynamically, providing greater flexibility than traditional partitioning methods.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Resizing**: Easily resize logical volumes as storage needs change.
- **Snapshots**: Create point-in-time copies of volumes for backup or recovery purposes.
- **Striping and Mirroring**: Improve performance and reliability by distributing data across multiple disks.
- **Pooling**: Combine multiple physical disks into a single logical pool for easier management.

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux-based systems (most distributions support LVM).
- **Disk Space**: At least one physical volume (disk or partition) to create logical volumes.

## Installation

LVM is typically included in most Linux distributions. To install or ensure it's installed, use the package manager for your distribution:

### For Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install lvm2
